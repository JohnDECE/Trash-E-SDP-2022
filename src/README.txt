Just make a new arduino project and copy all of these files into the arduino project folder.

Do this by simply copying the name of the arduino ino file and making a folder in the arduino project directory and renaming the folder by pasting the name you copied.

Then copy all of the files into the project folder.

Then read over the photo cell calibrator cpp file to understand the code and there are comments in CAPS explaining what you can edit.

Once you have made the appropriate changes, you should be able to just upload the code into the feather. MAKE SURE TO CHANGE THE BOARD SETTING IN ARDUINO IDE TO ADAFRUIT FEATHER ESP32
