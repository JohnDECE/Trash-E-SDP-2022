## ATMEGA328P Sensor Processing Code for Team 16's Trash-E of UMASS ECE Senior Design Project 2022.

This consists of a main.c file written with Microchip Studio. It contains code for controlling the 4 ultrasonic sensors and the Load Detection system of Trash-E.

At the time the ATMEGA328P used was configured with a 8Mhz internal clock scaled down to 1MHz through the /8 fuse enabled. 
This is important to get the correct functionality out of the sensors and code.
